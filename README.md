# 🚗 Car Damage Detection Using Deep Learning

This project focuses on detecting and localizing car body damage (e.g., scratches, dents, cracks, rust, paint fading) using state-of-the-art deep learning techniques. It is designed to assist in automotive insurance claims, fleet management, and smart vehicle assessment.

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a robust object detection system that can:
- Identify various types of car damages
- Localize damage areas using bounding boxes
- Provide visual evidence for damage classification

## 🧠 Models Used

We use two powerful object detection architectures:

1. **Faster R-CNN**
   - High accuracy
   - Good for applications where speed is less critical

2. **YOLOv8**
   - Extremely fast and efficient
   - Ideal for real-time detection

## 📁 Dataset

- Custom-annotated dataset of car images
- Includes various types of damage (scratches, dents, cracks, etc.)
- Annotated in COCO format using tools like CVAT or Roboflow

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python
- PyTorch / TensorFlow
- OpenCV
- Labeling: CVAT or Roboflow
- Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab for prototyping

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

- **Precision**
- **Recall**
- **mAP (Mean Average Precision)**
- **IoU (Intersection over Union)**
